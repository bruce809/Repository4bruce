goosepirate you developed Lox365: XLOOKUP for LibreOffice. It is very nicely done. 
Would you take a 5-10 minutes to help provide another function for LibreOffice?
The Project is "TYPEIN() compliments FORMULA() in LibreOffice Calc"

Since I do not program in Python or C++, I do not know their limitations.
Hiring a programmer is my aim, but I won't if TYPEIN() is impossible to code.
All that is needed is for you to note specifications that seem impossible to implement.
If it does seem feasible to you, would you be interested in programming TYPEIN()?

Here is a reference to a macro type solution. https://ask.libreoffice.org/t/could-typein-compliment-the-formula-function-typein-was-transfer-in-the-original-question/82370
  
  Thanks for looking,
  Bruce
